## Prefabs
### phunky-stream-panel
Based off of [jetdog's stream panel prefab](https://github.com/jetdog8808/JetDogs-Prefabs). Screen was rebuilt to use a separate game object, so that multiple screens can use the same video without having to load it more than once, triggers were changeed to allow the input of multiple video sources, and a trigger was added to disable master controls.
